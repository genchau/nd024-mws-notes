# Lesson 3.4 Handle The Response

### Handle The Response
Ok, you've learned about making a Fetch request, and you've sent a few of them off...but nothing happened because we didn't tell our code to handle the response. Let's get our code ready to handle the response.

Remember that Fetch is Promise-based. This means that when we fire of the Fetch request, it will automatically return a promise that we can use to listen for the response.

### ðŸ’¡ Javascript Promises Reminder ðŸ’¡
Dealing with the returned data from a Fetch request is all done with Promises, so if any of this looks confusing or you don't know how `.then()` works or why it's needed, check out our [course on JavaScript Promises](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898).

Since a Fetch request returns a Promise, then all you have to do is call `.then()` on that Promise.
```
fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}`, {
    headers: {
        Authorization: 'Client-ID abc123'
    }
}).then(function(response) {
    debugger; // work with the returned response
});
```
If you haven't already, put the code above in our JavaScript file and search for something. Because we added a `debugger` line inside the `.then()` function, the code will pause on the `debugger` line when the response is finally returned.
