# Lesson 13.2 Navigating with a screen reader

- VoiceOver for Mac
- [NVDA](http://www.nvaccess.org/) for Windows
- Orca for Linux

VoiceOver was built with support from web browser so it has a lot of in depth controls to allow faster navigation. Such as speed web page summary.

VoiceOver has a web router, which displays and speak all the major headings in the page. The order of the heading displayed in voice over is more logical and to the DOM, while the webpage display order is more tuned for visual display.

Headings are probably the most important feature that we can build into our pages to make them more uable for screen readers.
