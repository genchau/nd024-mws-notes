# Lesson 2.13 Outro

So how do we feel? HTTP is weird isn't it? But it is the foundation of the web as we know it, and the knowledge we just gained is invaluable and will help us understand why things behave the way they do. Before we dive into HTTP/2 though, we should talk about encryption in HTTPS. It is a highly misunderstood topic and has a reputation of being only for enterprise organizations and e-commerce sites. That is definitely not correct. So grab a drink. It's much simpler than it sounds.
