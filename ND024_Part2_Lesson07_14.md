- [X] Compression Level
- [ ] Display Size
- [ ] Actual (Natural) Size
- [ ] Type

```
Both images have the same natural size.
But they both have different size, one being almost doubled in size.
The compression level must have been set differently on both images.
Again, when designing for mobile first, if we can deliver a similar experience with less bytes we should do that.
