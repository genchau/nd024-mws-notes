# Lesson 16.2 The Problem

Wittr = a simple website containing a live stream of insightful gibberish from multiple users. It's a pattern we have seen on multiple social networking sites.

We can add this web app to the home screen so it looks like a native app. We call this a progressive app, 

**LIE-FI** is our biggest problem. There's a lot in between our phone and the server. Our phone sends the request to the Wi-Fi router or cell tower. Then onto the ISP, through intermediate proxies and potentially, across to the other side of the world. And eventually, the request reaches the destination server. But that's only half the journey, beause the server responds. And that response needs to go all the way back across the world through proxies, through ISPs, over the air and land safe and sound on your phone. But if something along the way fails, the whole thing fails. If something along the way run slowly, then the whole thing run slow and there in lies lie-fi. Problems can be caused by overloaded towers, such as crowded stadiums or a train station. Cell towers can't cope when people need it most. Or maybe there's a faulty or busy proxy. Maybe the destination server is busy or has a bug. Loads of stuff can go wrong and we can't predict any of this ahead of time. 

The worst thing we can leave the user with is nothing. **Let's do better.**
