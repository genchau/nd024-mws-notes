# Lesson 14.14 We Love Optimization

At Udacity we think responsive design and optimization is really important. Otherwise we wouldn't have made 4 courses on it. I've linked them all in the instructor's notes. I'll give you a moment to bookmark all the things. For further background on some of the things we'll be working through with images, definitely check out the Responsive Web Images course. Next, we'll chat a little bit about how we can optimize images.
