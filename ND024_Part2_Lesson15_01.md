# Lesson 15.1 Introduction to Style

We understand focus and semantics, 2 crucial pillars of accessibility.

To wrap up, we're going to work on styling. This is a broad topic.
1. Ensuring our elements are styled to support the accessibility of work that weve already done. This means adding styles for focus and various ARIA states.
2. Make sure our UIs are flexible, and can handle being zoomed or scaled up for users who may have trouble reading smaller text.
3. We'll talk about color choices, the importance of contrast and making sure we're not conveying information with color, alone.

Let's get started! :bowtie:
