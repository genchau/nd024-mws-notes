# Lesson 6.1 New Built-ins

In this lesson, we'll explore the latest batch of new built=ins provided in ES6. 

We now have:
- sets
- maps
- promises
- and a whole new bunch of other built-ins at our disposal.

It's taken a while for JavaScript to catch up, but these built-ins make it much easier for us to execute tasks that were once more difficult in earlier versions of the language. As you go through this lesson, you'll see how these new built-ins are structured, how they work, and when it's the most appropriate time to use them.
