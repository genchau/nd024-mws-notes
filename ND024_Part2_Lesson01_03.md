# Lesson 1.3 Intro to Project

Our project: The Brighton Times

It's currently not responsive. Lesson 2,4,5 will challenge us to improve the site's responsiveness.

*Make it clear that making a site responsive is more of an art, so there won't be one right answer. It's a subjective matter.* The more we practice, the better we get at creating good responsive sites. Approaching a site responsively from the start is ideal. 

Are you excited to get responsive? :sweat_smile:
