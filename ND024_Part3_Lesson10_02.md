# Lesson 10.2 From Notepad to IDE

Multitools are great. But a knife is better at the knife's job.

IDE vs editor.

IDE = Integrated Development Environment

IDE is similar to a Swiss army knife that can do it all. Editing, debugging, building, compiling and even, optimizing. But, IDEs come at the enspense of tools that do one thing really well. 

For apps ecosystems, such as iOS or Android, the vendor offers official support, and controls both the programming language, and platform. Which is why so many native developers use Xcode, Android Studio, or Visual Studio.

But on the web, we already have to live with fragmentation. Different browsers, devices and standards. We could try to pretend that CSS, HTML and JavaScript come in a beautiful tightly controlled bundle and build an idea around it. Or we could do what most web developers decide to do. Embrace the chaos and use individual tools best for each job while ensuring that they function well together.
