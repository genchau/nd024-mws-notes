# Lesson 10.12 Checklists

WCAG pronounced "wuh-cag"

We will need a roadmap to help with implementing accessibility.

WCAG = Web Content Accessbility Guidelines.

P = Perceivable = Perceivable by other senses than sight?
O = Operable = Can users use UI components and navigate?
U = Understandable = The interface does not cause confusion.
R = Robust = Able to be consumed by a wide audience.

WCAG can be overwhelming. WebAIM has distilled into an easier to follow checklist, targeted for web content.
