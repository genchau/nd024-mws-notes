# Lesson 13.4 Quiz: How Does Linting Help You Code

How does linting help our code?

1. Helps uncover code style problems.
    - Having a linting configuration for our project helps with code sharing and development with multiple team members. Linting certainly does help with all these and more.
2. Helps eliminate dead code or variables.
    - Some dead code is easily forgottenand can mess up our app in many obscure ways. And linting will help find many of these patterns. 

Linting does not help identify slow functions. Linting works purely by analyzing the actual source code. In order to find out how long a function takes to execute, it needs to run in the browser. 

Given the dynamic nature of JavaScript, often the type information is not known.
