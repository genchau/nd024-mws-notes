# Lesson 11.6 Test… All the Devices!!!

One of the mistakes that people often make is to only test their site's performance on the desktop. Because desktops are significantly more powerful than mobiles, it means you can miss performance issues that only show up when on device's CPU, memory or connectivity constrained. What you want to do is where you can, test on real devices. If you have an Android device, you can use the same Chrome DevTools you know and love from your desktop. So I can start it, interact, stop, and you can see I got a timeline that I can work with. If you don't have an Android device available, you can check out the instructor notes below for how to use the emulation settings in Chrome DevTools. Remember though, that the performance characteristics of simulators and emulators are wildly different to a device itself. So while it's good for getting used to the workflow, you'll need to test on the device itself to make sure that you don't have any performance issues there. In the next video, Peter Lovis is going to show you how you can use Chrome DevTools with your Andriod device. If you already know, just skip ahead.
