# Lesson 10.1 Lesson 2 Introduction

Welcome back. In the first lesson, you learned how the browser renders pixels from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Understanding this process is key to optimizing an app's performance. >> Right. And in this lesson, you'll take a step back to think at a high level about your app's life cycle as a whole. The goal is to help you make intelligent choices about when your app can and should do the heavy work to create a buttery smooth experience for your users. Now, before we start, I have a question for you. Should your goal be to make your app run at frames per second all of the time? >> Ooh, ooh, I know this one! >> Yeah. >> Okay can I answer it for them? >> Yes. >> Okay cool. The answer is no, actually, not quite. It's important that you pick your battles a bit, and focus on the things that matter to your end users. When you think about it, there are actually four major areas of any web app's life cycle, and performance fits into them in very different ways.
