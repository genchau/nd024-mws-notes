# Lesson 10.12 Quiz: RAIL Scenario 2

I want you to think through the idle stage. This user has just loaded an app with baseball scores on it. Right now they're in the millisecond idle period before they start to interact with the app. Which of the following tasks can you accomplish in this millisecond period? Can you fetch images for above-the-fold content? Can you start flipping some UI animations? Can you start some asynchronous requests for below-the-fold content? Or can you fetch images for below-the-fold content? Check all that apply

The correct answer here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want so long as it's not for above-the-fold content, which in all reality, the user should already have downloaded.

FLIP: First, Last, Invert, Play.
