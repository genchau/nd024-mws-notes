# Lesson 1.4 APIs

API - Application Programming Interface

There's lots of data out there just waiting to be used. A lot of data is fetch using APIs. 

Most APIs are free to use. Google offers a ton of APIs, including Google Analytics, Google Maps, Google Fonts. We can see in reddit, it interacts with a few different APIs to make reddit feel more dynamic. When a user clicks on a link that resolves to a YouTube video, Reddit opens up an embedded YouTube player. Or with the Twitter API to display the tweet right in Reddit.
