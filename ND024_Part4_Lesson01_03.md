# Lesson 1.3 HTTP Requests 2

How does HTTP work? In its original form, Berners-Lee came up with a template that we can fill in to make a request for a document on a server. The original protocal, later called HTTP 0.9, was incredibly limited. We fill in if we want to retrieve or store a document, where to store the document including the name and any additional information we think is necessary. This request has been handed to the server. Since the server speaks HTTP, it knows that this is an HTTP request and can therefore understand what the client wants. The protocol also has templates for the responses. These are a bit more versatile since a single request can have a variety of outcomes including errors, unreadable request forms, or re-routing the client to a completely different server. Luckily, Richard did a good job and I know what he wants. The only thing left for me to do is fill out this form so Richard knows which request I'm responding to.
