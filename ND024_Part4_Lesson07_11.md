### Exercise: The bookmark server
You're almost to the end of this lesson! One more server to write â€¦

You've probably seen URL-shortening services such as TinyURL or Google's goo.gl. They let you create short URI paths like http://goo.gl/xLcHvY that redirect to a longer URI on another site. It's easier to put a short URI into an email, text message, or tweet. In this exercise, you'll be writing a service similar to this.

Like the messageboard server, this bookmark server will keep all of its data in memory. This means that it'll be reset if you restart it.

Your server needs to do three things, depending on what kind of request it receives:

- On a GET request to the / path, it displays an HTML form with two fields. One field is where you put the long URI you want to shorten. The other is where you put the short name you want to use for it. Submitting this form sends a POST to the server.
- On a POST request, the server looks for the two form fields in the request body. If it has those, it first checks the URI with requests.get to make sure that it actually exists (returns a 200).
    - If the URI exists, the server stores a dictionary entry mapping the short name to the long URI, and returns an HTML page with a link to the short version.
    - If the URI doesn't actually exist, the server returns a 404 error page saying so.
    - If either of the two form fields is missing, the server returns a 400 error page saying so.
- On a GET request to an existing short URI, it looks up the corresponding long URI and serves a redirect to it.

The starter code for this exercise is in the 7_BookmarkServer directory. I've given you a skeleton of the server; your job is to fill out the details!

BookmarkServer.py:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# A *bookmark server* or URI shortener that maintains a mapping (dictionary)
# between short names and long URIs, checking that each new URI added to the
# mapping actually works (i.e. returns a 200 OK).
#
# This server is intended to serve three kinds of requests:
#
#   * A GET request to the / (root) path.  The server returns a form allowing
#     the user to submit a new name/URI pairing.  The form also includes a
#     listing of all the known pairings.
#   * A POST request containing "longuri" and "shortname" fields.  The server
#     checks that the URI is valid (by requesting it), and if so, stores the
#     mapping from shortname to longuri in its dictionary.  The server then
#     redirects back to the root path.
#   * A GET request whose path contains a short name.  The server looks up
#     that short name in its dictionary and redirects to the corresponding
#     long URI.
#
# Your job in this exercise is to finish the server code.
#
# Here are the steps you need to complete:
#
# 1. Write the CheckURI function, which takes a URI and returns True if a
#    request to that URI returns a 200 OK, and False otherwise.
#
# 2. Write the code inside do_GET that sends a 303 redirect to a known name.
#
# 3. Write the code inside do_POST that sends a 400 error if the form fields
#    are missing.
#
# 4. Write the code inside do_POST that sends a 303 redirect to the form
#    after saving a newly submitted URI.
#
# 5. Write the code inside do_POST that sends a 404 error if a URI is not
#    successfully checked (i.e. if CheckURI returns false).
#
# In each step, you'll need to delete a line of code that raises the
# NotImplementedError exception.  These are there as placeholders in the
# starter code.
#
# After writing each step, restart the server and run test.py to test it.
