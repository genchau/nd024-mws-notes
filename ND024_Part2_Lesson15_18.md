In this lesson:
- There are a lot of interesting facets to accessibility worth considering when you're building your app.
- A well laid out focus strategy is extremely important.
- But without focus styling, that effort goes to waste.
- Semantic markup is critical to assistive technology users.
- When we style off semantic properties, we can ensure a consistent experience for all of our users.
- Ensuring all text meets a minimum color contrast ratio is an easy way to improve readability for everyone.
- All responsive design benefits all mobile device users.
- Keeping all that in mind means our final product is going to reach more users.
- Those users are just going to have a better time using our app.
