# Lesson 2.1 The jQuery Library & Ajax

jQuery is a JavaScript library. We use it by linking it in our html with `<script>`. 

To compare it with the baking a cake concept, jQuery is like hiring a baker to bake the cake for us. Behind the scenes all the same steps to bake the cake is being done, but being done by someone else. Which means less work for me to do. So I can work on getting other things done.
