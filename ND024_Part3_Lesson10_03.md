# Lesson 10.3 Set Up Your Editor

Choosing the right editor can be tricky due to the overwhelming options and religious developer battles. It's almost as bad as the ongoing battle of tabs versus spaces, or semicoln haters and lovers. In this course we'll stick with sublime text 3.

Sublime is 4-5 times more popular than the competition. It's extendable, fast, and very well supported by our community. For free alternatives check out GitHub's Atom editor. It builds on a similar plugin architecture. It's the new kid on the block, and gets better everyday. 

- Fast enough
- Can be extended with functionality
- Well supported and stable
