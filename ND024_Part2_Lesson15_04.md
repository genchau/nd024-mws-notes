# Lesson 15.4 Input Modality

Native elements will react differently to different input devices. Such as mouse hovering will not show focus ring, but keyboard focus will show focus ring.

Our custom buttons will not have this feature, it'll treat both mouse hover and keyboard focus with the same styling.

This behavior will also be different across different browser so watch out for that. But things are continually evolving, and support may be added for these functionalities.
