# Lesson 12.1 Lesson Intro

Live editing is kind of like having a power drill to assist in our work flow.

For web development: We make a change in the code, save, rebuild, switch to browser and reload the page. These micro task switches might seem harmless, but they can add up when doing them thousands of times a day. 

Live editing solves the problem. A watcher is in the browser. When we save a file, these 2 communicate and the website is reloaded or patched on the fly. So now, we can have our editor and browser side by side and see real live updates as we code.
