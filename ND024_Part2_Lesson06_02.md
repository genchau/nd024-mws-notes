# Lesson 6.2 Why Responsive Images?

- We have to be careful on mobile.
- Images on average consume more than 60% of the bytes to open a web page.
- We can't always rely on the bandwidth.
- Images don't always work so well on different devices.
- Scrolling both vertically and horizontally is a terrible experience.

"Create a product, don't re-imagine one for small screens. Great mobile products are created, never ported." -Brian Fling

Great designers don't optimize for mobile, they thing responsively, to build sites that work across a range of devices.
