# Lesson 2.14 Start Small

Good practice is to start the design with the smallest form factor, like a phone. Then move up to the next size and the next, until there's no point in going any wider. 

Benefit of starting small:
- Important content gets prioritize.
- Performance is prioritize at the beginning of the design.

:see_no_evil: Working the other way around, starting big:
- We'll likely include too much content to display to users
- We'll give the most immersive and heavy visuals which can lead to slower performance on slower network connections.
