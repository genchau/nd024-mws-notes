# Lesson 2.4 HTTP Verbs 2

Remember the requests starts off with an HTTP method, the path, and the version of the HTTP protocol to use. This request is using the HEAD method. HEAD is an interesting method as it allows you to get the headers of a file without having to receive the entire file itself. This lets you check if there's enough space to store the response or if the cached version on that page is still up to date. This way, the browser can avoid re-downloading a file if it already has the most recent versions in its cache. Looking at the network tab and dev tools, we probably won't see any head requests when visiting our websites. The problem with using HEAD for cache validation is that we're doing twice the work. We send a HEAD request and then possibly a GET request right afterwards. **Every request response pair is called a round trip and they take a lot of time to complete.** With a sheer number of access that websites have nowadays, having to send the HEAD requests before the potential GET request would slow down the loading of the website considerably. There are ways to mitigate the cost of these round trips and we'll talk about them later. But for now, it is just important to know that **we want our sites to have as few round trips as possible.** And that means reducing the number of requests as best as we can. The last of the common methods is OPTIONS. OPTIONS is supposed to give you a list of methods that are accepted on the current URL but not every server supports this. The OPTIONS method might seem odd at first, but becomes very important when we start talking about course which we'll cover later.
