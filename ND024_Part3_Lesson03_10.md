# Lesson 3.10 Course Outro

Thanks for joining me as we progress through the different ways to make AJAX requests. You now have three tools up your sleeve whenever you need to make async requests. You can make requests using the tried and true but somewhat cumbersome xhr way, you can use the jQuery library to smooth out making async requests using its API, and then you use the Fetch API to make promise-based asynchronous requests. Using these tools, you can now make dynamic requests from your JavaScript that don't force Apache refresh and provide an overall better experience for your users. Now, before you go start making async requests in all of your apps, would it be bad if we had a little taste test?
