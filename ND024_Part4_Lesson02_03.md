# Lesson 2.3 HTTP Verbs

HTTP has been around for such a long time that the protocol still does something that we'll rarely find in any modern protocol. It's regular text and can be read by a human. The bytes being pushed back and forth on the network are plain, old, regular text and can be read by our human brains. HTTP's simplicity also means that we can directly interact with a protocol without a 3rd party library doing any extra work for us. Every HTTP request begins with a unique verb called a method and serves a specific purpose. We already know GET and POST. And although these are the most common methods, there are other methods we will encounter regularly. The common set of methods consist of 
- GET, 
- POST, 
- PUT, 
- DELETE, 
- HEAD, 
- OPTIONS.

We will talk more about these methods when we talk about REST APIs.
