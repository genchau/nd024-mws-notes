# Lesson 2.2 Pixels, pixels and moar pixels!

The browser does not report physical hardware pixels, instead it reports **DIPs, device independent pixels.**

Example: The browser has a viewport width of 1280 DIPs. The 1280 DIPs get scaled up to 2560 hardware pixel.

We have to specifically tell the browser that our site was designed to work on a small screen. If not, it would assume a 980 DIPs wide. Imagine that content being scaled to fit a 360 DIPs phone, that's less than half., **YUCK!** The browser then tries font boosting and guess what content is important.
