# Lesson 7.12 File formats

JPEG can lead to edge artifacts when the picture is zoomed in.
SVG is better with crisp edges. File size is down as well.

Comparing 3 file formats, JPEG, SVG, PNG, SVG is 1/25 the size of the PNG in the example.

General rule of thumb:
- Use JPEG for photographs
- or WebP which delivers better compression (check browser compatibility.)
- Use SVG whenever possible for vector images.
- Use PNG for vector images if unable to use SVG.
- Use PNG over GIF.
