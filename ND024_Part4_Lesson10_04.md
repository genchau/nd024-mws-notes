# Lesson 10.4 Quiz: Idle Time

In this quiz, you'll be thinking about this hypothetical news app. Inside the app, users will be reading articles like this one, about how California's in a drought. They'll be looking at images like this one in London, where they actually do get rain. And they'll be watching videos like this one, where a Golden Retriever is writing some JavaScript because that's definitely something that could happen. You've booched up the app to render content above the fold pretty quickly. You also know from your analytics that most people look at a page for a couple of seconds, before they start interacting. So, with that in mind, what kind of tasks should you handle during this post-load idle state? Should you load the text for news stories like this one or that one? Should you load image assets like this one, this one, or that one? Should you load videos like the web deb Golden Retriever? Should you load the app's basic critical functionality? Or should you load the comments section? Check all that apply.

The correct answer is everything except for the news text and the basic critical functionality. In order for the app to even work, you've got to deliver the basic critical functionality. So this shouldn't be coming after the load. Also, people would be visiting a site like this specifically to read the news text, so they should be there as soon as the first pixels are being painted. Everything else though, like images, videos and the comments section can come later. In fact, this is probably a pattern you've seen before on other apps. Keep in mind, however, that user actions could actually still happen during the post load idle state. And in a moment you'll learn that you only have one hundred milliseconds to respond to those actions. This makes it all the more important to keep the post load task that you're performing to **fifty millisecond chunks**.
