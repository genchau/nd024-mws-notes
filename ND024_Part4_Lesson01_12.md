# Lesson 1.12 Outro

We have looked at the request and response cycle of HTTP, so now we have a solid understanding on how HTTP works and what a browser actually does when we visit a website. We know how metadata is attached to both requests and responses, and we know how to request additional documents using JavaScript. Next we'll take a closer look at the HTTP protocol and the actual bytes that are being sent back and forth between the server and the browser.
