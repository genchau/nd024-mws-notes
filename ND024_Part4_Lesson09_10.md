# Lesson 9.10 Quiz: Layout

For this quiz, I'm giving you a sample DOM, there's a body with a div container underneath it. And then a child div underneath the container, you can find a simple site with this same DOM in the instructor notes below. If you make changes to the geometry of any of these elements, the browser will have to run layout. So, my question for you is, which of these elements, well when changed include more of their parent elements in the scope of the resulting layout. In other words, will changing the geometry of any of these elements trigger layout against most or all of the page? If so, which one triggers more? You can use the sample site to find out, clicking once makes a change to the body, clicking again makes a change the top level dev, and the last click changes the child dev. If you're already familiar with DevTools, you can record a timeline trace to see what layout happened after each click on this page. If not that's no big deal, you'll be learning how to use the timeline next lesson, and i'll be demonstrating how to find information about layout in the solution video. You can also check out the link in the instructor notes for a little bit more information. So, do some analysis if you can, but otherwise make a prediction. Will changing the width of the body trigger layout with a larger scope than changing the width of this div, or will they have the same scope? Pick one of these answers.

Right! No matter what, layout needs to be run against the whole page.

Believe it or not the correct answer is that they have the same scope. In both cases the browser has to assume the worst. Meaning that the change invalidated the entire dom. The browser then has to keep the entire dom in scope while it's running layout. This is the timeline panel in dev tools which you'll be spending quite a bit of time with later in this course. To see what happens when I click around on the page, I will go ahead and click this button which starts recording and then I will click once, twice, three times and then stop recording. Like I said, you'll be spending quite a bit of time with this tool later in the course, so I’m going to quickly zoom in and show you what you need to see. This is the first click event which affected the geometry of the body. You can see that the click lead to other pieces of work, including this one right here. Which is the layout that was triggered. I can scroll down and see that the scope of the layout was the whole document. Which means that the entire dom was in scope. Okay now that shouldn't be too surprising because the click effect the body. But I wonder what it looks like for the other two elements. Here's the second click event, which affected the top level div. And this is the resulting layout. Notice that, in this case, the scope is still the whole document. Meaning the whole DOM was in scope for this layout event. Now I'll look at the last one. Here's the last click event on the child div. So this div is the farthest down on the DOM. And here's the resulting layout. Once again, notice that the scope of this layout is still the entire DOM. You may have noticed as I was going through the clicks that the different layout events affected different numbers of nodes. But the whole time the entire dom was in scope. In case you're wondering, it's possible but very difficult to limit layout scope. You can use something called a layout boundary but Paul and I won't be getting into that in this class. Check out the instructor notes for more information. So if there is one take away from this question, it's that the layout process is complicated and it's probably best to assume that the entire dom is always in scope.
