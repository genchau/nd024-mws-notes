# Lesson 7.12 You did it!

You know, it took me several tries to get the URI shortening server right for that last exercise. And even though it looks pretty bare bones when you see it from the browser, there's a lot of things going on in there. There's different response codes. There's a couple of headers. There's parsing the post body. All in all, my version turned out to be about a lines of code. If you got that code working too, you should feel proud of yourself. Go get a cookie. Oh hey, speaking of cookies. Web cookies are one of the many things we're going to be talking about in less than three. See you then.

### You did it!
In this lesson, you've built up your knowledge of HTTP by building servers and clients that speak it. You've built Python programs that act as web servers, web clients, and both at once. That's pretty awesome!

The next lesson will be a tour of some more advanced HTTP features that are essential to the modern web: cookies, encryption, and more.
