### Udacity - Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Program ND024 - Notes
This is the personal space I'll be using to take course notes. They are more or less written for my own needs so they will not necessarily be 100% complete or even comprehensible. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: If there's something I already know or understand, I'll usually not write in any notes. 

This repository is a work in progress, therefore the [table of contents](ND024_TableOfContents.md) will probably have a lot of broken links. The reason for that is because I have a spreadsheet with a list of the lessons, which I use string concatenation to auto-generate links to the placeholder filenames. So that links are already in place in the table of contents, but the file may not necessarily exist just yet.

Alright! Let's put in :100: effort so we can enjoy that :beer: and  :sushi:.
Elon keep building those :rocket:.
