# Lesson 7.9 Raster and Vector

Raster images: photographs and other images represented as a grid of individual pixels.

Vector images: logos, line art, which can be defined as a set of curves, lines, shapes, fill colors and gradients. These are created with vector-based programs like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. The files are saved as .SVG.

SVG advantages includes small file sizes and absolutely no quality distortion when resizing.
