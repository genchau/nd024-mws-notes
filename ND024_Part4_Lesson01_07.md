# Lesson 1.7 Exercise Setup

### Server Binaries
To get a feel for the way a client and server communicate, we've created a bunch of servers that you'll use to complete hands-on exercises. To prevent any issues, we've created binaries that you'll download and launch to run the server locally.

### Launching the Server
1. on the quiz page, download the exercise binary located at the bottom of the page, under the Supporting Materials section image

2. unzip the file
3. locate the binary for your platform
4. launch the binary by double-clicking on it
