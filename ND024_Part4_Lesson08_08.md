# Lesson 8.8 Keep learning!

### Resources
Here are some handy resources for learning more about HTTP:

- [Mozilla Developer Network's HTTP index page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) contains a variety of tutorial and reference materials on every aspect of HTTP.
- The standards documents for HTTP/1.1 start at [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230). The language of Internet standards tends to be a little difficult, but these are the official description of how it's supposed to work.
- The standards documents for HTTP/2 are at https://http2.github.io/.
- If you already run your own web site, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a great site to learn about HTTPS in a hands-on way, by creating your own HTTPS certificates and installing them on your site.
- [HTTP Spy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/http-spy/agnoocojkneiphkobpcfoaenhpjnmifb?hl=en) is a neat little Chrome extension that will show you the headers and request information for every request your browser makes.
