<summary>Solution:</summary>
<p>

"The image is sized so that it is as small as possible while still completely filling its container."
- [ ] contain
- [X] cover

"The image is sized so that it is as large as possible while still being completely visible inside its container."
- [X] contain
- [ ] cover

With cover, the image gets cropped so that the smaller dimension matches the smaller dimension of the container. The whole container is *covered* with the image, but part of the image may get cropped out.

With contain, the whole image is visible, but it may leave white space in the container.
