# Lesson 3.2 Securing HTTP

At this point, we are painfully aware that HTTP is very easy to read even for humans. We can almost literally want to request fly-by on a console and still understand what is going on. So I think we can agree that if someone manages to somehow eavesdrop on an open HTTP connection, the eServer can read all the requests and responses, and extract all the data they need. But how easy is it to eavesdrop on a connection? As I mentioned in the introduction, Wi-Fi makes it much easier as you're literally broadcasting our connection over radio waves. So all someone needs to do is listen and with special listening software, it gets even easier. Look in the instructor notes for more information about this. Encrypting the Wi-Fi will help, but you have no control over the settings of the Wi-FI at a cafe and old encryptions are easily breakable. That's why one feature of HTTPS is encryption. It will make your browser encrypt requests in a way that only the server we're connected to can decrypt them. Neither the store owner nor the malicious eavesdropper at our local cafe will be able to read our data stream. But what if we think we're connected to the right server when we're not? Man in the middle attack or MITM for short, the attacker gets between me and the server we're trying to connect to. When this happens, our browser will make an encrypted connection to their server, as if the server we thought we were trying to connect to, like Facebook. The attacker will decrypt our data, read all of our private information, re-encrypt it and forward it to Facebook's server and vice versa. Neither Facebook nor I would know that they are sitting in the middle. To remedy this, HTTPS's other features besides encryption is authentication. The seller will have to identify itself in a way only the real server could, so we can be sure that we are talking to the right server.
