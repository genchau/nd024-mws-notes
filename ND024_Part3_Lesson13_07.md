# Lesson 13.7 Unit Testing in Gulp

We've just learned how to protect ourselves from syntax and coding style issues. But as we know, this doesn't ensure our code does what it's supposed to do. In order to test the functionality of our code, we should create unit tests. Unit tests are essentially JavaScript functions that pragmatically test an API or aspect of our project. 

I should check out the [JavaScript testing course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549) on Udacity.

The purpose of this course, we assume that we know the basics over learned in layout. And thus we provided a sample test suit as part of our sub lab. Unit test, like Linton, are here to prevent mistakes. Wouldn't it be cool if we could automate running them just like everything else was set up so far with our built. Well there's one issue with that. The unit test for our front end only makes sense if we run in a browser. Thus, running them from the terminal environment won't do any good. But this doesn't mean it's impossible, it's just slightly more tricky.
