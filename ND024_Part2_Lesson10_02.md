# Lesson 10.2 What is Accessibility

Accessibility applies to all of us. We have all experience times when a site or content just isn't **access**ible to us. Say for example a desktop optimized site on our mobile device, or a youtube video that is not available in our country.

We are largely concerned with accessibility in the narrowest sense of ensuring users with disabilities can access content.

However addressing accessibility issues in the narrow sense very often improves the user experience for everyone.

Improving a form for accessibility actually improves the design for all users:
- Low contrast text
- Form labels opposite side of form fields.
- Label not associated with the check box. Making the label not checkable.

Improving for accessibility reduces stress and errors for all users.

Improving accessibility is not a **ZERO SUM GAME.**
