# Lesson 12.9 The Accessibility Tree

Imagine building a user interface for screen reading only. No visual UI at all. Well, in essence we will be creating an API describing the page structure, dom API. 

This enables a screen reader user to jump in between high level sections and then get enough information about each form element's affordances to know how to fill them in.

The browser takes the DOM tree and modifies it to turn it into a form which is useful to assistive technology. This modified tree is refer to as the accessibility tree.
