# Lesson 5.13 JavaScript's Illusion of Classes

Classes in JavaScript are different than other classes in other languages, but the general concept is all the same. 

In other languages, we use classes to create objects and provide inheritance. 

In JavaScript, we use functions to create objects. So when we create a new dessert like this, dessert is just a regular function. And being able to inherit data and functionality in JavaScript happens through prototypal inheritance. Exactly. Just because ECMAScript has provided us with new keywords like class, super, and extends, it doesn't mean the entire way the language works has changed. So JavaScript still uses functions and prototypal inheritance under the hood. We just have a new cleaner way to write the same functionality, right? You got it. But keep in mind, that the underlying functionality of the language hasn't changed. Okay. So JavaScript is not a class-based language. It uses functions to create objects and links objects together by prototypal inheritance. Yep. JavaScript classes are just a thin mirage over regular functions and prototypal inheritance.
