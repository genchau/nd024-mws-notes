# Lesson 1.1 Welcome Aboard
Hi Richard!

Welcome to the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree program, or MWS.
Browsing the web on a mobile device has surpassed desktops/laptops.
There are 2.6 billion smartphone users worldwide.

This Nanodegree program is broken down into 3 stages:
1. Develop responsive mobile-first websites
2. Access and use dynamic content by fetching remote data and storing it for offline use.
3. Communicate back and forth with a server, so our web app behaves like a native app.

This Nanodegree program provides:
- Expert code review on our projects
- Access to content built by our industry partners
- Udacity's best in class instructions :wink:

After completing this program:
- Take Google's mobile web specialist certification exam :bowtie:
