We can't ignore new changes to JavaScript, even if we think we are a pro. We have to get up, dig into the features, read the specification, follow some tutorials, maybe even write some of our own.

The web is an evolving platform and we need to evolve with it. Imaging being stuck on old horrible equipment when there are newer nicer tools available for us to use. We know how JavaScript language improvements are made and where to find browser support for them. We have the tools. We just need to use them.
