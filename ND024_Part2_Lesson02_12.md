# Lesson 2.12 Tap Target Sizes

>Argh, stupid small phone, stupid small buttons, stupid big fingers. :confounded:

**Tap targets = anything that a user might touch, tap, click, or try and do input on.**

Mouse can be highly accurate with inputs on a screen. 

> Our fingers, on the other hand, and sorry about that pun, it was bad.

Our fingers are about 10mm wide, or half an inch wide, this works out to *40 CSS pixels.*

We should make our **tap targets 48x48 CSS pixels, and 40 pixels between tap targets.**
