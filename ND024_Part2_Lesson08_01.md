**Latency - The delay between request and response.**

The speed of light, you know, it's so last century. :sunny:

Latency is the new bottleneck in modern internet experience. It turns out that for many modern web pages, bandwidth doesn't matter as much as latency does.

Bottom line, performance is a fundamental part of a truly responsive mobile design. 

**In practice, we need to:**
**- reduce file sizes**
**- reduce the number of file requests.**

In this lesson, we'll learn about lots of different ways to achieve graphical effects without image files.
