Modern web technologies often lead to inaccessible contents for visually impaired people.

Users without vision will be relying on screen readers. Or be using a braille display.

Many websites are visual and lack keyboard navigation which is essential for blind people to move around the site.

Visual impaired people may be using large print text, magnification, text to speech, color contrasting, etc.

Visual impairment includes poor color vision.

Other Impairments include:
- Motor or dexterity.
- Hairing impairments.
- Cognitive impairments.
- or just stress.

Some statistics on disability for the US:

- Around 2% of the population has some kind of vision disability (i.e. are blind or have significant difficulty seeing even with glasses)
- Around 50% of the population has some kind of clinically significant refractive error (a visual impairment which may be corrected with glasses if mild enough)
- Around 8% of males and 0.5% of females have some form of color vision deficiency
