# Lesson 9.1 Course Introduction

Instructors: 
Paul Lewis, Developer Advocate at Google. 
Cameron Pittman, front end web development courses at Udacity. 

We're here to help you develop apps that run at a silky smooth frames per second. And you may think it's just JavaScript that you need to worry about but there's actually a lot more to it than that. This course is about changing the way that you approach performance issues. We're going to help you look at the bigger picture. >> Okay let's play a game. This was made by my colleague Jake Archibald and it's designed to show off problems with frame rates and performance on the web. See these ships at the top? They move smoothly. The ones at the bottom judder. The game is super simple, shoot the juddering ships as quickly as you can by clicking on them. You're going to have to spot them amongst the smooth ones. >> Okay, I'm going to shoot the juddering ships. That's a hard, weird British word. >> It's an amazing British word. >> I think you made it up. >> It's just English, which means I can't be wrong. >> That's not true. >> That's very true. You are not doing well. >> That's not great. Well anyway, I hit the wrong one, but I hope you could do a lot better.
