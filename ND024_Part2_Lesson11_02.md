# Lesson 11.2 What is Focus?

The currently focused item is often indicated by a focus ring.


Move focus around the page using your keyboard:

- `TAB` will move focus forward
- `SHIFT - TAB` will move focus backwards
- `Arrow keys` can be used to navigate inside of a component

The ordering is call **tab order**.

As developers we should ensure we have a logical tab order in place.

Built-in interactive HTML elements like input, button, and select are all implicitly focusable.

But not all elements are focuable. Headers, paragraphs, and images are not focusable.
