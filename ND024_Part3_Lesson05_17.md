# Lesson 5.17 Super and Extends

### Subclasses with ES6
Now that we've looked at creating classes in JavaScript. Let's use the new super and extends keywords to extend a class.
```
class Tree {
  constructor(size = '10', leaves = {spring: 'green', summer: 'green', fall: 'orange', winter: null}) {
    this.size = size;
    this.leaves = leaves;
    this.leafColor = null;
  }

  changeSeason(season) {
    this.leafColor = this.leaves[season];
    if (season === 'spring') {
      this.size += 1;
    }
  }
}

class Maple extends Tree {
  constructor(syrupQty = 15, size, leaves) {
    super(size, leaves);
    this.syrupQty = syrupQty;
  }

  changeSeason(season) {
    super.changeSeason(season);
    if (season === 'spring') {
      this.syrupQty += 1;
    }
  }

  gatherSyrup() {
    this.syrupQty -= 3;
  }
}

const myMaple = new Maple(15, 5);
myMaple.changeSeason('fall');
myMaple.gatherSyrup();
myMaple.changeSeason('spring');
```
Both Tree and Maple are JavaScript classes. The Maple class is a "subclass" of Tree and uses the extends keyword to set itself as a "subclass". To get from the "subclass" to the parent class, the super keyword is used. Did you notice that super was used in two different ways? In Maple's constructor method, super is used as a function. In Maple's changeSeason() method, super is used as an object!

### Compared to ES5 subclasses
Let's see this same functionality, but written in ES5 code:
```
function Tree(size, leaves) {
  this.size = (typeof size === "undefined")? 10 : size;
  const defaultLeaves = {spring: 'green', summer: 'green', fall: 'orange', winter: null};
  this.leaves = (typeof leaves === "undefined")?  defaultLeaves : leaves;
  this.leafColor;
}

Tree.prototype.changeSeason = function(season) {
  this.leafColor = this.leaves[season];
  if (season === 'spring') {
    this.size += 1;
  }
}

function Maple (syrupQty, size, leaves) {
  Tree.call(this, size, leaves);
  this.syrupQty = (typeof syrupQty === "undefined")? 15 : syrupQty;
}

Maple.prototype = Object.create(Tree.prototype);
Maple.prototype.constructor = Maple;

Maple.prototype.changeSeason = function(season) {
  Tree.prototype.changeSeason.call(this, season);
  if (season === 'spring') {
    this.syrupQty += 1;
  }
}

Maple.prototype.gatherSyrup = function() {
  this.syrupQty -= 3;
}

const myMaple = new Maple(15, 5);
myMaple.changeSeason('fall');
myMaple.gatherSyrup();
myMaple.changeSeason('spring');
```
Both this code and the class-style code above achieve the same functionality.
