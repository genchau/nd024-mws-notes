# Lesson 14.16 Introducing ARIA Live

`aria-live` allows developers to mark a part of the page as live, in the sense that updates should be communicated to users in a timely manner. One example might be a status message.

`aria-live` = live region of a page.

3 allowable values:
`aria-live="off"`
`aria-live="polite"`. Alert the user to this change after completing the current task. Example is usage in a chat to alert that a new message has arrived.
`aria-live="assertive"`. This will interrupt whatever is happening an make an announcement right away. Example is usage in a server error.
