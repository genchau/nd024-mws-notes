# Lesson 6.7 Congratulations!

Now I've been working with servers since the late '90s, and every time I find myself talking to a server by hand like that, I feel like I'm getting away with something sneaky. It actually turns out you can do something similar with email servers to send fake email. Don't be evil though, OK? But seriously, there's only so much you can learn about web servers and clients by pretending to be one by hand. In the next lesson, you'll write code to do that for you. And as it turns out, a piece of code that pretends to be a web server, well, it is a web server. Sneaky.

### Congratulations!
You have demonstrated your ability to play the part of an HTTP client or server by hand. You can carry out conversations in HTTP with all manner of interesting clients and servers.

Fortunately, Python makes it much easier than this when building real web applications. Rather than sending and answering HTTP requests by hand, in the next lesson, you'll be writing Python code to do it for you.

### Downloadable exercises
In the next two lessons, you'll be doing several exercises involving running Python server code on your own computer. To get ready for these exercises, you'll need to download the starter code. To do this, open your terminal and run these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-ud303
cd course-ud303
git remote remove origin
```
This will put your shell into a directory called course-ud303 containing the downloadable exercises. Take a look around at the subdirectories here. For each exercise, you'll be using one of them.
