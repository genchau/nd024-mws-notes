Udacity Offline First course.

We are increasingly reliant on the internet. But the internet isn't always with us. The sinking feeling of being abandoned by connectivity. You're stuck outside while the internet parties without you. You can only imagine what you're missing out on. It could be anything, literally anything. A new video of a cat, a politician saying something stupid, world peace could be solved in 140 characters, but you don't get to hear about it. 

Total failure in the face of connectivity issues is a worst case scenario. And it's all too common on the web, but no longer. 

In this course, we're going to cover how you can build sites and apps that work great whatever connection the user has. We're going to use service worker to intercept network traffic, explore the latest service worker in dev tools. We're going to tame IDB, the in browser database, and explore user experience strategies to deal with varying network conditions and updates.
