# Lesson 3.9 Fetch Outro

The new fetch API is awesome in so many ways. You can make a complicated request involving custom headers and caching or a simple request using just the URL to the resource. There are also new headers, requests and response interfaces. On top of this, but just promise base, so it naturally helps you create easy to write asynchronous calls in your code. In the past, making asynchronous calls has been somewhat tedious, but thankfully with the new fetch API, things have gooten a whole lot easier.
