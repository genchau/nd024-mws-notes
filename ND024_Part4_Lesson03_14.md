# Lesson 3.14 Outro

Security is an important but sometimes intimidating aspect of web development. If we didn't know what HTTPS was before this lesson, we should feel much more comfortable with it now. Most hosting services and CDN's have support for TLS nowadays and with more and more browser API's being enabled for HTTP web sites only, we should always use HTTPS for our users and our own sake. In the next lesson, we'll take a look at the new HTTP/2 standard and what that means for me and my project build steps.
