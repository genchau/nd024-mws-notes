# Lesson 14.1 Intro to Semantics: ARIA

Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about user input widgets, structures, and behavior, to allow specific technologies to convey appropriate information to people with disabilities.

Our web app has been made accessible by using a sensible DOM order, which helps with logical focus strategy, which lays the groundwork for a rich keyboard experience.
- Use of built-in keyboard interactions.
- Sophisticated custom keyboard event handling.
- Using native elements for optimal keyboard usability.
- Built in semantics used by assistive technology.
- But we also need to think about labeling controls and images.
- Add page structure using headings and other semantic HTML elements to provide landmark information.
- The importance of links.
- All of these are built into HTML.

But HTML built-in accessibility features does not cover everything we may need. 
- For example, there's no standardized HTML element for a drop down menu.
- Also subtle semantics like, the user needs to know about this as soon as possible.

In this lesson, we'll learn how we can express semantics which HTML can't on its own.
