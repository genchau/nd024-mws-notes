# Lesson 5.1 Updates to Functions

In this lesson, we're gonna cover updates to functions in the ES6. Functions have changed a lot since the last version of JavaScript. We got a new way to write functions called arrow functions, and a new class keyword that lets you create functions as classes. That's not all. In ES6, you can now set up default function parameters. Plus, you can connect different classes together using the new "super" and "extends" keywords. Yeah, there have been a lot of new changes. Well, we better get started before any more charges are added. Wait, what, more changes?
