# Lesson 16.13 Introducing Service Worker

Problem:
- Zero connectivity is a bad experience.
- Low connectivity is maddening and previously there was nothing we could do about it. All we do is make a request and then it's entirely out of our hands. It might work, it might now, it might be fast, but it might not. We have zero control until the request succeeds. If it succeeds.
- That story changes with a relatively new browser feature called service worker.

Solution:
- This is the feature that solves everything, the feature that gives developers new powers over the network. 

Service Worker advertisement:

For too long, users have been left staring at a white screen. For too long, they've been let down by the cruel seas of network connectivity. And for too long we've been powerless to help. 

We've been left waiting. But no longer.

A new browswer feature has arrived. A total game changer.

A feature that lets you control the network rather than letting the network control you.

What is this new feature?

What promises does it bring?
