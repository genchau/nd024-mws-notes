# Lesson 12.6 Quiz: Long Running JS

[Here's the site for analysis](http://jsbin.com/feloni/3/quiet)

For this quiz, you're going to be comparing the time it takes two functions to run. One function will run when you hit Sort by name, and the other when you hit Sort by number. You can find a link to the site in the instructor notes below. I want you to use DevTools to analyze what happens when you hit these two buttons, and make sure you've got the JavaScript Profiler enabled. One of these buttons will take longer to sort this list than the other. I'll give you a hint that the slow function, one of these two, is going to be using a bubble sort which happens to be super, super slow. The other of these two functions is going to be using JavaScript's built in sort function which is way faster. The point of this quiz question isn't necessarily about which sort function you should use, though in fact the built in one is normally great. This question is about being able to see, at a glance, how much work is going into a frame. So, with that in mind, which function takes longer to run, onSortOne or onSortTwo?

I'll start off by enabling the JavaScript profiler, I'll hit record and then I'll hit both buttons. There's , and there's the second. To give myself more space I'll pop this into a second window. WIth the flame view enables it's pretty obvious to see what's going on here. Here's the first click and here's the second . As a child of the first click event on sort run. And, as a child of the second click event on sort run. And just looking here it's pretty obvious that answer took longer to run. Before I move on, I want to point out some interesting bits in this little sample. If you're in the flame view and you click on the top-level click record like this one here, you can pull up the details pane for some useful information. This pie chart gives you an idea of how much time it took different events caused by this function to run. You can get the scripting time for this function itself, which tells you how long it took just this function to run. And if this function called any others, which this one did, then you can see how long it took it's children to run. In this case the function that ran on the click called other functions including the bubble sort one, which is included in this children scripting time. I've changed over to the second click event for the second event and you can see that the scripting time for its children, is only milliseconds, which is about half of answer . I want you to notice one other thing. After the first click there is a recalculate style and then a layout event, and after the second click there is another recalculate style and another layout event. These two pairs of recalculate style and layout are essentially the same length. This is a clear indication that no matter how you sort the data in this example, you still have to write out the whole table of results, which is going to require recalculating styles, relaying out the page, and repainting everything. So with all that in mind,answer took longer to run.
