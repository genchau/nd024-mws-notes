# Lesson 9.5 Frames

If there's any kind of visual change onscreen, from scrolling to animations, the device is going to put up a new picture, or frame, onto the screen for the user to see. Most devices today refresh their screen times a second, which we measure in hertz. And so to match that we need to have frames to put up. Most of the time we'll refer to this as frames a second or fps. People are especially good at noticing when we miss one of these frames. And they don't like it. Think of how easy it was to spot in Jank Invaders. If the browser is taking too long to make a frame, it will get missed out. The frame rate will drop and users will see stuttering. If it's really bad, then the whole screen can lock up, which is the worst.
