# Lesson 14.9 Breather

ARIA allows us to add extra semantics into our HTML via attributes. It allows us to modify the accessibility tree without changin anything else about the presentation or behavior. By default, it won't affect styling nor will it affect interactive behavior. It only affects assistive technology users.

We already looked at how we can use ARIA to change an element's role, state and properties.

Next stop, we're going to learn a little more about how ARIA's semantics interact with native HTML semantics. We're also going to look at some special ARIA attributes which allow us to define some more nuanced realtionships between elements that what we can express in the DOM. And we're going to lie about how and why we can choose to hide or show information exclusively for assistive technology users.
