# Lesson 2.1 HTTP Intro

As developers, we use HTTP everyday. We issue GET and POST requests when using Firebase's JavaScript SDK or just when using the browsers on our tablets or mobile phones to look at websites. To be a good front-end engineer creating web apps, merely using HTTP is not good enough. We will need a deeper understanding to see why certain techniques are being used and why others either don't work or aren't recommended. In this lesson, we will start with a look at the first version of HTTP. We'll examine the GET and POST methods, and a few other useful methods we might not be as familiar with. We'll look at a variety of headers and how API's are designed to work well with the web. By the end of this lesson, we'll be able to debug HTTP request response pairs on the wire and will understand what a RESTful API is.
