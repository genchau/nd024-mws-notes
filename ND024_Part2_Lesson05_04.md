# Lesson 5.4 Responsive Tables - Hidden Columns

Hidden columns essentially means hiding columns based on importance.

The biggest problem with hiding columns is that we're hiding contents. If the user is on a smaller viewport there's no way for that user to access the additional info that he might need. **Use hidden columns with caution.** If possible, abbreviate data instead of hiding it.

Using CSS to hide columns in tables:
```
.longName {
  display: none;
}
.inning {
  display: none;
}
```
