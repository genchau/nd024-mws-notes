# Lesson 15.8 Responsive design for multi-device Pt. 2

Responsive site will behave nicely when a user requires magnification. So just having a responsive site will satisfy WebAIM checklist item 1.4.4. 

meta viewport:
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

Please refrain from using:
- max-scale=1
- user-scalable=no

Use relative sizing:
- 50%
- 0.5em
- 2.0rem

Make sure touch targets are sized at 48px and have a margin of 32px.
