# Lesson 9.1 Responding to Screen Capability & View

- Serving one single file for every context is not ideal.
- The image we want to serve for a 4K TV we won't want to serve to a watch. 
- Last lesson, we used media query. Which was kind of messy. To do it properly, we needed to write CSS for many use cases.
- Media query is an attempt to guess at build time what image file will be best at run time. 
- Instead, we should give the browser information to make the best choice possible.
- Another problem, media queries only refer to the viewport dimensions, not the actual display size of the image.
