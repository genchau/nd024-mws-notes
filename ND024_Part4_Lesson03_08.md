# Lesson 3.8 Quiz: Hashing Quiz

Use the hashing project. 
Enter random text.
Copy and past the output into the quiz.
Then alter the text a little and copy and paste the SHA 256.

We can see even a small change of 1 character is enough to completely change the hash to be nothing alike the previous hash. That's how hash allows us to check if files have been tampered with.
