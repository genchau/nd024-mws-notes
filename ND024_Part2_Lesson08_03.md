# Lesson 8.3 CSS Techniques

CSS can also be used for other graphical effects. 
- Shadows
- Rounded corners
- Gradient
- Animations

It does cost processing and rendering power to use these CSS effects. This is more significant with mobile devices. So use appropriately and sparingly. (I wonder if this still applies to 2018 smartphones. This video is from early 2015.)
