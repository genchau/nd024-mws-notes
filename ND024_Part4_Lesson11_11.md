# Lesson 11.11 Quiz: Finding Janky Functions

[Sample site for your analysis](http://jsbin.com/nanana/2/quiet)

In the instructor notes, you'll find a link to this website. Just like before, hit Record and hit Switch Layout. Record a timeline trace, and see if you can figure out where the jank is coming from. Once you think you've found the source of the Jank, type the name of the function into this box.

The trace for the site is looking actually pretty close to frames per second, but it's not quite there. All the big purple bars are a pretty good indication that there's probably too much layout happening. Just like before, I want to find the cause of the jank, so I'll zoom into the beginning of the trace to see what started this mess. When I zoomed in it becomes pretty apparent that there's something wrong with these layouts. These red triangles definitely look like warning signs to me. I've clicked on one, and then inside the Details pane I see a warning. The warning says that, Forced synchronous layout is a possible performance bottleneck. Well, this seems like a pretty useful message, and where's it happening? Right here, a function called totesLayingOutYo. What? Paul come on, why would you name it that? Well, anyways, it's coming in at the quiet script on line . I think this might be the culprit. Just to make sure, I've clicked on the function that led to this force synchronous layout, and it's pointing me to the quiet script, too. And there it is, there's Paul's weird function, totesLayingOutYo. On line , he's setting offset width which is forcing layout. And there you have it, there's the source of the jank. This time the jank wasn't caused by the function that started it. But, in fact, it's a function that's being called every time a new frame has to be run. This time the jank isn't caused by a function running at the beginning of the script, it's a function that's being called every frame by requestAnimationFrame. This means the correct answer is totesLayingOutYo. By the way, Paul and I will come back to this example later on in the course. You'll learn just a little bit more about what you're seeing here and what this performance issue is.
