# Lesson Project.2 Project Instructions & Rubric

### Steps to complete
1. Fork and clone the [server repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2). You’ll use this development server to develop your project code.
2. Change the data source for your restaurant requests to pull JSON from the server, parse the response and use the response to generate the site UI.
3. Cache the JSON responses for offline use by using the IndexedDB API.
4. Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.
5. Submit your project code for review.
