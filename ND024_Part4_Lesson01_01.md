# Lesson 1.1 Intro

This course: Client Server Communications

The web is a small part of the internet. The web is the platform, the I, the web developer, uses to publish our ideas to the world. Every time we open a browser, download an app, receive a message, we are using the web. A client is communicating with a server and vice versa. 

What happens when we navigate to a website?
How did the phone know that somebody sent me a message?
What capabilities does the web have?
What are its limitations?

Instructors:
- Surma, engineer at Google in London, works on the Chrome team.
- Richard, course developer at Udacity, and an experienced web developer.

In this course, we'll learn what the web actually is, how we can use it to our advantage, and how we can avoid mistakes that will make both our user expereience and security suffer. We will dive into the lesser known parts of HTTP. To think like an engineer, we need to understand both the semantics of HTTP users, as well as the implementation inside the browser. We'll use that knowledge to use browser APIs to the fullest potential, secure HTTP against eavesdroppers, and deploy the web's newest protocol, HTTP/2. All this knowledge will help us make informed decisions for our app and persuade others when optimizing and securing their apps. 

- HTTP's request and response cycle
- Security
- Best practices of HTTP/2

Understanding both the capabilities and limitations of the medium we work in on a day to day basis will help us take the next important step towards mastery. 

By the end of this course, we will understand literally every byte that is being sent from our browser to the server and back.
