# Lesson 9.3 Lesson Introduction

Throughout this course you'll be working on a bunch of samples with performance issues. But by the end of the course, you'll be applying what you've learned to make silky, smooth experiences. >> But first, in order to develop an app that runs at frames per second, you need to understand what goes into creating each frame. In this lesson, you'll be getting the background knowledge that you need about the browser's rendering pipeline. If you've taken web performance optimization with Ilya Gregorich and me, this will seem pretty familiar. >> Right. The point of this lesson is to help you experience what potential bottlenecks may slow down rendering. In the next lessons, you'll be diagnosing and solving common performance issues, as well as getting a sense for how to approach performance at different stages in your app's life cycle. >> Right-o. Let's get going. >> Wow.
