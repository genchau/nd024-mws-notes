# Lesson 6.19 More Promises

Check out our Promises course where we'll take a deep dive into:

- JavaScript Promises
- how to handle returned data and errors
- build an app called Exoplanet Explorer that uses JavaScript Promises to fetch remote data asynchronously

Promises make it so much easier to do asynchronous code. With Promises, our code's going to be easier to read, easier to write, and most importantly, it's easier to debug.
