# Lesson 9.8 Accessibility

The web is visual. But for the visually impaired, screen readers are essential to make sense of the web. 

[LYNX â€“ The Text Web-Browser](http://invisible-island.net/lynx/) is a **text-only** browser which can help us see how the web will be presented to our visually-impaired friends.

[ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) is a screen reader we can install as a Chrome extension.

It's very important we use meaningful alt texts when designing our websites.

- Alt tags should be descriptive for important images.
- Alt tags should be empty for decorative images.
- Alt tags should be set on every image just like this pig is set on beign so darn cute.
