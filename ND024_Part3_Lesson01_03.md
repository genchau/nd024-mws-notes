# Lesson 1.3 Ajax Definition & Examples

Ajax requests allow for content retrieval and display without reloading the web page. Asynchronous in Ajax refers to the fact that the request doesn't block other events from happening. Ajax requests occur in a number of different ways, and with varying levels of difficulty. Some require an API key, others use Oauth, and some don't use any authentication. Data returned is different too.

X stands for XML, but Json is more popular today.

A little history. In the early days, webpages were rendered server side then delivered to users. Every new page (clicks) was rendered again on server and the whole new page was delivered. This was very slow and used a lot of bandwidth for interactivity. AJAX changed the game, made things a lot faster, new data was shown almost instantaneously.
