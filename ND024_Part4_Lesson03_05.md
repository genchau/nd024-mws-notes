# Lesson 3.5 TLS and Certificate Authorities

When we talk about HTTPS, we are actually talking about 2 different concepts. HTTP and TLS, formerly known as SSL. We already know about HTTP, and TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. TLS is not specific to HTTP, but any protocol can use it. For example, there is FTPS, which is FTP with TLS, to transfer files securely. TLS encrypts communication in a way that can't be read by anyone else other than the intended recipients. In practice, it is impossible to break a TLS encryption. To ensure that we're talking to the server we intend to talk to, TLS utilizes something called, a chain of trust. A server identifies itself with a certificate that contains both a little metadata about itself and the fingerprint of its encryption key. These certificates are issued by one of a handful certificate authorities. If the certificate is signed by such an authority, we know that if the key we're using matches that fingerprint, then we're talking to the correct server. The list of certificate authorities can actually be found in the browser. We could even add our very own authority if we wanted to. What we see here are mostly companies that we can buy certificates from. They cost money as they not only validate our server, but also validate our identity as the ownder of that server. Since not every developer can or wants to pay money for a certificate to offer basic security to the users. "Let's Encrypt" has come into the marker and offer certificates for free. Let's take a closer look at how certificates work and the security they provide.
