# Lesson 4.9 Outro

As far as we are concerned, HTTP/2 works the exact same way HTTP/1 does. What changes is the performance and the precautions you have to take. You should start building a web app with HTTP/2 in mind since a number of browsers that don't support HTTP/2 is getting smaller and smaller. If you're running your own server or trying to figure out where to hose your web app yourself, make sure to enable HTTP/2 there, too. 

In the next lesson, we'll take a look at more security measures like cross origin resource sharing, same origin policy, and cross-site scripting. You might even get a chance to do some hacking yourself.
