# Lesson 14.16 Quiz: How Should We Compress This Image

Hamburgers are generally small in dimension and have a limited palette. So we can get sufficient improvement by either using a lossy compression algorithm or converting it to SVG. 

Our hero image needs to have crisp quality to show that it's large and in charge. We should use lossless compression on it. 

Lastly, image thumbnails don't need to be pixel perfect and we want them to load fast. So applying a lossy compression algorithm works well for our needs.
