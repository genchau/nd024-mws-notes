# Lesson 14.1 Lesson Intro

Great editing environments, safety nets in place? Check and check. What else could we need? Well, we've optimized our development workflow but that's about it. Now think about all the things that we do or should do after we finish coding and planning a release. Things like unifying and concatenating our source files and optimizing our images. In today's mobile world, we see hundreds of different devices, browser, and screen combinations that use our app or site. In some cases, it's simply impossible to optimize by hand. This is where our build process steps in. We'll use it to optimize things that we can't fix by hand, or simply take too long. And doing so will make our build more powerful, so that it takes a raw source code and polishes it for production.
